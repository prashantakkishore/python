Also we can make zip and distribute

python3 setup.py sdist --format zip

output -
creating dist
creating 'dist/printer-1.0.zip' and adding 'printer-1.0' to it
adding 'printer-1.0/PKG-INFO'
adding 'printer-1.0/printing.py'
adding 'printer-1.0/setup.py'
removing 'printer-1.0' (and everything under it)
